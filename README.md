An angular 2 vis.js project (in a very early development stage)

## Demo
* [Demo Page](https://seveves.github.io/ng2-vis)

## Work in progress:
Timeline and Network components are implemented and using DataSets for two-way binding.
Currently they lack unit tests and the demo page is only showing basic examples but this will be fixed till the first minor release.
I am trying to add the other components as soon as possible in the following order:
* Graph2D
* Graph3D

Contributions of any kind are very welcome! Just check the issues and see what I am currently working on.

### Misc
* testing npm package
* writing more unit tests
